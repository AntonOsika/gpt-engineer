# GPT Engineer Online
**Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it. Now all run in the web.**

GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt. 
######
This Repository's main goal is to bring the great help that the AntonOsika/gpt-engineer project gave to people, but make it easier to use by adding it to the web.

## Project philosophy
- Simple to get value
- Add to the WWW
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps".
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Fast handovers back and forth between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem


## Usage


### Limitations
Implementing additional chain of thought prompting, e.g. [Reflexion](https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion), should be able to make it more reliable and not miss requested functionality in the main prompt.

Contributors welcome! If you are unsure what to add, check out the ideas listed in the Projects part of the github repo.
